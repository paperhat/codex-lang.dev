# Namespace and SchemaImports Plan Overview

This plan is only a plan. It makes no changes.

## Goal
Add SchemaImports and qualified names while preserving deterministic parsing, validation, canonicalization, and schema resolution.

## Principles
- Every step is small and reviewable.
- Every step fits easily within a one hundred thousand token context window.
- No changes are made without explicit approval.

## Work Breakdown
1. Specification plan
2. Grammar plan
3. Bootstrap schema plan
4. Implementation plan
5. Conformance plan
6. Documentation plan

Each plan is in its own folder and file named index.
