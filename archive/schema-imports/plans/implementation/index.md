# Implementation Plan

This plan is only a plan. It makes no changes.

## Step 1: Data structures
Define the new data structures needed for:
- SchemaImports block
- Namespace table
- Qualified name references

Deliverable: a data structure list for review.

## Step 2: Parser changes
List the parser changes required to recognize SchemaImports and qualified names.

Deliverable: a parser change list for review.

## Step 3: Resolver changes
Define how schema loading and namespace resolution work, including error cases.

Deliverable: a resolver procedure for review.

## Step 4: Canonicalization changes
Define how SchemaImports and qualified names are formatted in canonical form.

Deliverable: canonicalization rules for review.

## Step 5: Validation changes
Define how validation uses qualified names and imported schemas.

Deliverable: validation notes for review.

## Step 6: Approval gate
Wait for approval before any edits.
