# Codex Language — Specification & Reference

This repository hosts the **canonical specification and reference documentation** for **Codex**, a declarative semantic language for expressing structured meaning independent of runtime, presentation, or target platform.

The content published here is **authoritative** unless explicitly marked otherwise.

---

## Purpose

This site exists to:

- define the Codex language (syntax, semantics, invariants)
- publish normative contracts and rules
- document architectural principles and design constraints
- establish public, timestamped prior art
- serve as a stable reference for implementers

It is **not** a marketing site, tutorial hub, or community portal.

Those concerns live elsewhere.

---

## Scope

This repository includes:

- language grammar and syntax rules
- semantic models and invariants
- formatting and round-trip guarantees
- core architectural contracts
- reference examples (clearly labeled)

Out of scope:

- implementation details of specific libraries
- hosted services or operational infrastructure
- product positioning or sales material

---

## Normative vs Informative Content

Documents are explicitly labeled as one of:

- **NORMATIVE** — binding language or system rules
- **INFORMATIVE** — explanatory or illustrative material

Only **Normative** documents define Codex behavior.

If a document is not labeled, it should be treated as **Informative**.

---

## Versioning

- Codex specifications are versioned.
- Each published version is immutable once released.
- Later revisions supersede earlier ones but do not invalidate them.

URLs are intended to be stable and citable.

---

## Authority & Governance

Codex is an open language with **strong editorial governance**.

- The specification is public.
- The specification is not crowd-designed.
- Changes follow an explicit review and ratification process.

This model prioritizes coherence, long-term consistency, and semantic stability.

---

## Licensing

- Specification text: © respective authors, all rights reserved unless otherwise stated.
- Code samples (if present): licensed as noted in the file header.

Licensing details will be clarified per document as the project matures.

---

## Status

Codex is under active development.

The presence of a document here does **not** imply finality, only intent.

---

## Related Projects

- **Paperhat** — the primary ecosystem and reference implementation
- Additional libraries and tools will be linked as they become public

## Contact / References

This repository is intended to be referenced, not discussed.

For now, issues and pull requests may be closed without response.
