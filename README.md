# Codex Semantic Markup Language

This repository publishes the **canonical specification and system contracts** for **Codex**, a declarative semantic language for expressing structured meaning independent of runtime, presentation, or target platform.

This site is intentionally minimal.
It exists to define **what Codex is**, **what compliant systems must do**, and **where authority resides**.

---

## What Codex Is

**Codex is a language.**

It is used to author:

* semantic structure
* meaning and constraints
* behavior (as data)
* presentation policy
* bindings to environments

Codex is **not** a framework, toolkit, or UI system.
Those are applications *of* the language.

---

## Repository Structure

Authority is expressed structurally.

This repository is organized into the following top-level areas:

* specifications
* contracts
* examples
* notes
* scope and status material

Documents that define required behavior are marked **Normative**.
Documents that explain, motivate, or discuss are **Non-Normative**.

---

## Specifications

Codex language specifications are:

* versioned
* immutable once published
* intended to be stable and citable

The existence of a specification defines authoritative language behavior for that version.

---

## Contracts

Contracts define **obligations, boundaries, and guarantees** for systems and libraries that implement or operate on Codex.

Each contract is:

* a named artifact
* versioned independently
* authoritative within its declared scope

Compliance is explicit and non-ambiguous.

---

## Governance

Codex is maintained under a **strong editorial governance model**.

* Normative content is authoritative.
* Changes to LOCKED documents are deliberate and versioned.
* Final authority rests with the Specification Editor.

See **`GOVERNANCE.md`** for formal governance rules.

## Status

Codex is under active development.

The presence of material in this repository establishes **intent and authority**, not finality.

---

## Scope Note

This repository is a **reference**.

It is not:

* a tutorial site
* a community forum
* a marketing property

Those concerns are intentionally handled elsewhere.

---

*Clarity, coherence, and correctness take precedence over popularity.*
