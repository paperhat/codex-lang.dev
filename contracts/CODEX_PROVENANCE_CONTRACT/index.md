# Codex Provenance Contract

This document defines **provenance in Codex**.

It specifies how authorship, generation, and derivation are **declared**, **named**, and **interpreted** within Codex documents.

This contract governs **provenance semantics**, not provenance tooling or workflows.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this contract is to:

* record authorship and derivation **declaratively**
* make origin and lineage inspectable and queryable
* avoid executable, procedural, or workflow semantics
* keep provenance strictly orthogonal to domain meaning

Provenance exists to describe **where something came from**, not **what it means**.

---

## 2. What Provenance Is

**Provenance** describes the **origin, authorship, and derivation** of Codex Concepts, Entities, and Annotations.

Provenance:

* is **descriptive**, not prescriptive
* does **not** imply trust, correctness, or authority
* does **not** affect domain semantics
* is intended for inspection, auditing, and tooling

Provenance never alters the meaning, validity, or interpretation of the artifact it describes.

---

## 3. Provenance Context (Normative)

Provenance is expressed **only within a schema-defined provenance context**.

In the Codex module-assembly schema, provenance is carried inside the structural Concept:

* `Provenance`

Outside a schema-defined provenance context, provenance Concepts have **no special meaning**.

---

## 4. Provenance Scope

Provenance MAY apply to:

* an entire `Module`
* a specific Entity within a Module
* a derived Concept or plan
* an **Annotation** (editorial or output)

Schemas MUST define which Concepts and Annotations may carry provenance.

Provenance MUST NOT be attached implicitly.

---

## 5. Provenance Concepts (Module Context)

Within the Codex module-assembly context, the following **Structural Concepts** are defined for provenance:

* `Provenance`
* `AuthoredBy`
* `GeneratedBy`
* `DerivedFrom`

These names are **contextual** and have meaning only within the module provenance context.

---

## 6. Authorship

### `AuthoredBy`

`AuthoredBy` declares authorship or responsibility.

* It is used for attribution only
* It MAY reference a human, organization, or agent Entity
* Multiple authors MAY be declared
* It MAY apply to Concepts **and Annotations**

Plain-English reading:

> “This was authored by X.”

Authorship does not imply ownership, authority, or correctness.

---

## 7. Generation

### `GeneratedBy`

`GeneratedBy` declares the tool or agent that generated an artifact.

* It is declarative
* It does not imply determinism or reproducibility
* It does not imply endorsement or correctness
* It MAY distinguish human-authored from machine-generated artifacts

Plain-English reading:

> “This was generated by X.”

---

## 8. Derivation

### `DerivedFrom`

`DerivedFrom` declares lineage.

* It references another Entity or Annotation
* It asserts derivation, not equivalence
* It does not encode transformation steps or workflows

Plain-English reading:

> “This was derived from X.”

---

## 9. Annotations and Provenance (Normative)

Annotations are **first-class artifacts** for provenance purposes.

This includes:

* editorial annotations (`[ ... ]`)
* output annotations (`<Annotation>`)

Annotations MAY carry provenance that:

* describes authorship or generation of the annotation
* records derivation (e.g. copied, summarized, translated)
* does **not** affect the meaning of the annotated Concept

Annotations MUST NOT inherit provenance implicitly from the Concepts they annotate unless a schema explicitly defines such inheritance.

---

## 10. Reference Semantics

Provenance Concepts use **reference Traits** to identify Entities or Annotations.

* References MUST point to valid Entities or Annotations
* Provenance references MUST NOT form cycles unless explicitly allowed by schema
* The reference singleton rule applies unless schema permits otherwise

---

## 11. Identity Rules

By default:

* Provenance Concepts are **not Entities**
* Provenance Concepts MUST NOT declare an `id`

Exceptions:

* A schema MAY explicitly authorize identity for a provenance Concept
* Such authorization MUST be explicit and documented

Absent explicit authorization, assigning an `id` to a provenance Concept is a validation error.

---

## 12. Ordering

If multiple provenance entries appear:

* lexical order is preserved
* order has **no semantic meaning** unless schema explicitly defines one

---

## 13. Non-Goals

This contract does **not**:

* define trust models
* define access control or authorization
* define workflow or pipeline semantics
* encode execution history
* replace external provenance standards

It defines **Codex-native provenance only**.

---

## 14. Summary

* Provenance in Codex is declarative and descriptive
* It records authorship, generation, and derivation
* It may apply to Concepts **and Annotations**
* It never alters domain semantics
* Its meaning is contextual and schema-defined
* Provenance is inspectable, not executable
