# Codex Glossary

This glossary defines terms used in the Codex specification. It is informative unless a term is explicitly marked as normative.

Format notes:

- Each term is a single line entry in a definition list for easy scanning.
- Terms are added in alphabetical order.
- Definitions should be plain English and avoid specification legalese.
