## Terms

### Parameterized value type

A value type token with type arguments (for example, `$List<$Text>`) that constrains the types of collection elements.

---

### ParseError

An error class for inputs that cannot be parsed into the Codex surface structure.

---

### PascalCase

A name composed of ASCII letters and digits that begins with an uppercase letter.

---

### PatternConstraint

A constraint that requires a specific Trait value to match a regular expression.

---

### Precision-significant number

A Numeric Value spelled with a `p` suffix that declares decimal precision.

---

### Property shape IRI

The deterministic IRI used for a property shape derived from a node shape and a trait or child.

---

### Qualified Name

A name of the form `namespace:ConceptName` or `namespace:traitName` that references a Concept or Trait definition from an imported schema. The namespace prefix identifies the imported schema; the local name follows standard naming rules. Defined in §4.1.1.

---

### Range Value

A declarative interval spelled with `x..y` and optional step `s`.

---

### Record Value

---

### reference trait

A reference trait expressing that a Concept mentions or depends on another Concept for meaning.

---

### ReferenceConstraint

A constraint type that enforces rules about reference traits.

---

### ReferenceError

An error class for invalid or unresolved reference traits.

---

### Resolution table

The mapping from lookup tokens (`key`) to `id` values built from Concepts in the document.

---

### Round-trippability

The guarantee that canonical Codex can be mapped to RDF and reconstructed without loss of meaning.

---

### Rule

A logical rule in the constraint model built from atomic constraints and rule combinators.
