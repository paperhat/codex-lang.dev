# Codex Specification Governance

Status: NORMATIVE
Version: 0.1
Editor: Charles F. Munat

---

## Authority

The Codex Language Specification is maintained under a **strong editorial governance model**.

- The specification is public.
- The specification is open to review.
- The specification is not crowd-designed.

Final authority over **Normative** content rests with the **Specification Editor**.

---

## Origin and Stewardship

Codex was originated by **Charles F. Munat**, who serves as the **Specification Editor**.

The Codex Language Specification is stewarded under a **single-editor governance model** to ensure long-term coherence, semantic integrity, and architectural consistency.

The Specification Editor holds final responsibility and authority for:

- defining the canonical meaning of the Codex language
- approving, rejecting, and ratifying normative changes
- maintaining versioned, authoritative specifications
- determining compatibility, conformance, and compliance criteria

While the specification is public and open to review, **decision-making authority over Normative content is centralized** in the Specification Editor in order to preserve clarity, continuity, and conceptual integrity.

If the Specification Editor is unable or unwilling to continue in this role, editorial authority may be transferred by the outgoing editor, or, in their absence, by a process publicly defined in this repository.

This stewardship model is intended to prioritize correctness and long-term stability over consensus or majority rule.

---

## Normative Changes

Changes to **Normative** documents:

- must be explicit and intentional
- must preserve backward compatibility where feasible
- must be versioned
- are ratified by the Specification Editor

Once published, a specification version is **immutable**.

---

## Informative Content

Informative documents:

- may change without formal process
- do not define required behavior
- may be removed or rewritten freely

---

## Implementations

This repository defines **language behavior**, not implementations.

Implementations may:

- reimplement the specification
- extend it experimentally
- diverge intentionally

Only the specification defines Codex itself.

---

## Compatibility & Claims

Use of the terms “Codex”, “Codex-compatible”, or similar claims of compliance may be subject to additional requirements defined by the Specification Editor.
