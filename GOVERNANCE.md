## Authority

The Codex Language Specification is maintained under a **strong editorial governance model**.

- The specification is public.
- The specification is open to review.
- The specification is not crowd-designed.

Final authority over **Normative** content rests with the **Specification Editor**.

---

## Origin and Stewardship

Codex was originated by **Charles F. Munat**.

The Codex Language Specification is stewarded under a strong editorial governance model to ensure long-term coherence, semantic stability, and architectural consistency.

The **Specification Editor** is responsible for:

- defining the canonical meaning of the Codex language
- approving and ratifying normative changes
- maintaining versioned, authoritative specifications
- determining compatibility and conformance requirements

While the specification is public and open to review, final authority over **Normative** content rests with the Specification Editor.

This stewardship model prioritizes clarity, continuity, and correctness over consensus.

If the Specification Editor is unable or unwilling to continue in this role, editorial authority may be transferred by the outgoing editor, or, in their absence, by a process publicly defined in this repository.

---

## Normative Changes

Changes to **Normative** documents:

- must be explicit and intentional
- must preserve backward compatibility where feasible
- must be versioned
- are ratified by the Specification Editor

Once published, a specification version is **immutable**.

---

## Informative Content

Informative documents:

- may change without formal process
- do not define required behavior
- may be removed or rewritten freely

---

## Implementations

This repository defines **language behavior**, not implementations.

Implementations may:

- reimplement the specification
- extend it experimentally
- diverge intentionally

Only the specification defines Codex itself.

---

## Compatibility & Claims

Use of the terms “Codex”, “Codex-compatible”, or similar claims of compliance may be subject to additional requirements defined by the Specification Editor.
