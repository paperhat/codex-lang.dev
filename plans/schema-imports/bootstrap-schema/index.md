## Step 1: Concepts and traits

- Unique namespace per import
- Valid reference value
- Non empty namespace

Deliverable: a constraint list for review.

## Step 3: Canonical bootstrap changes
List the exact canonical bootstrap schema locations that must change.

Deliverable: file and section list.

## Step 4: Simplified bootstrap changes
List the exact simplified bootstrap schema locations that must change.

Deliverable: file and section list.

## Step 5: Approval gate
