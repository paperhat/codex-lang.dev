# DOCUMENT_STYLE_AND_TONE_SPEC

**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Lock State:** LOCKED  
**Audience:** All Codex Participants  
**Non-Audience:** Runtime engines, application developers

---

## 1. Purpose

The **Document Style and Tone Specification** defines the mandatory stylistic, tonal, and grammatical constraints for all Canonical Specifications and Contracts within the Paperhat Codex corpus.

Its purpose is to:

- preserve clarity and precision
- prevent rhetorical drift
- eliminate ambiguity introduced by tone or phrasing
- maintain long-term readability for non-developers

Style discipline is a semantic safety mechanism.

---

## 2. Normative Position

This specification:

- is subordinate to all previously LOCKED canonical documents
- introduces **no new semantics**
- constrains expression, tone, and form only

In the event of conflict, this document yields to earlier LOCKED contracts.

---

## 3. General Style Invariant

All canonical documents MUST be written such that:

- meaning is explicit
- interpretation is unnecessary
- enforcement is mechanical
- review does not depend on author intent

If meaning depends on tone, the document is invalid.

---

## 4. Sentence Structure

### 4.1 Required Form

Sentences MUST:

- be declarative
- be complete
- express exactly one claim or rule

Compound sentences are permitted only when unavoidable and MUST be unambiguous.

---

### 4.2 Prohibited Forms

Sentences MUST NOT:

- be rhetorical
- be interrogative
- imply suggestion or advice
- include illustrative storytelling

---

## 5. Modal Verbs

### 5.1 Permitted Modals

The following modal verbs are permitted and MUST be used precisely:

- **MUST** — mandatory requirement
- **MUST NOT** — absolute prohibition
- **MAY** — optional permission
- **SHOULD** — strongly encouraged but not required

No other modal verbs are permitted.

---

### 5.2 Prohibited Modals

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- could
- might
- would
- ought to
- expected to

Their use constitutes a compliance violation.

---

## 6. Voice and Perspective

### 6.1 Voice

- Active voice is preferred
- Passive voice is permitted only when the actor is irrelevant or universal

---

### 6.2 Perspective

Canonical documents MUST:

- avoid first person
- avoid second person
- avoid collective voice (“we”, “our”)

All rules are stated impersonally.

---

## 7. Tone Constraints

The tone of all canonical documents MUST be:

- neutral
- authoritative
- non-persuasive
- non-apologetic

The following tonal elements are prohibited:

- encouragement
- warnings phrased emotionally
- humor
- informality
- emphasis through exclamation

---

## 8. Prohibited Language Constructs

Canonical documents MUST NOT include:

- metaphors or analogies
- rhetorical emphasis
- hedging language
- approximations
- subjective qualifiers

Examples of prohibited terms include:
_generally_, _usually_, _often_, _in most cases_, _as needed_.

---

## 9. Enumeration and Lists

Lists MUST:

- be exhaustive
- be clearly scoped
- avoid “including but not limited to”

If a list is not exhaustive, it MUST be stated explicitly.

---

## 10. Headings and Section Titles

- Headings MUST be descriptive
- Headings MUST NOT be rhetorical
- Headings MUST NOT imply interpretation

Numbered sections MUST reflect logical hierarchy only.

---

## 11. Emphasis and Formatting

The following formatting rules apply:

- Bold MAY be used for defined terms
- Italics SHOULD be avoided
- Underlining is prohibited
- Capitalization follows the Naming and Vocabulary Specification

Formatting MUST NOT be used to imply importance beyond normative language.

---

## 12. Examples and Illustrations

Examples, illustrations, and hypothetical scenarios are **prohibited** in Canonical Specifications.

Educational materials must be non-canonical.

---

## 13. Consistency Rule

Within a document:

- terms MUST be used consistently
- sentence patterns SHOULD be consistent
- structural symmetry SHOULD be preserved where possible

Inconsistency constitutes a compliance violation.

---

## 14. Enforcement

- Orchestrators MUST reject documents that violate style or tone rules
- Validators MUST flag violations explicitly
- Human Authorities resolve escalations related to stylistic disputes

No role may waive stylistic compliance.

---

## 15. Canonical Status

This document is **CANONICAL** and **LOCKED**.

Any canonical artifact that violates this specification is **non-compliant with Paperhat Codex**.
